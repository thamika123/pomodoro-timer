# Pomodoro Timer

A simple pomodoro timer app built with React and Tailwind CSS, based on the
requirements
[here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Pomodoro-Clock.md).
The work timer is set to 15 minutes, and the break timer to 5. The site will
automatically switch between timers, and the user can pause, start and reset
the timer also. See it live [here](https://react-pomo-timer.netlify.app).
